# Basic-Statistical-Analysis-on-the-Iris-Dataset
 This project performs basic statistical analysis on the **iris** dataset using R. It computes the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation for each numeric feature, visualizes data with histograms, scatter plots, and boxplots, and generates a heatmap for the correlation matrix to explore relationships.
